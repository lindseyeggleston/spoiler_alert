# Spoiler Alert!

### Project Overview
I will use a recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) to generate new believable dialogue between characters from the Song of Ice and Fire book series.

speech recognition
language modeling
lstm allows for more contextual memory


### Approach

Stage 1: Problem Framing
- Identify problem
- Outline project approach
- Define realistic MVPs
- Product: Clear and concise project objective in readme file and comprehension project timeline

Stage 2: Data Preprocessing
- Extract character specific vocabulary and term frequencies from their respective chapters
- tf-idf with nltk and gensim
- Product:

Stage 3: RNN
- RMSProps or Adam adaptive learning rate methods
- Product: a trained rnn model

Stage 4: Test Model
- vectorize new data (scenarios for character dialogue)
- Product:

Phase 5: Web App and Visualization
- S
- Product:
